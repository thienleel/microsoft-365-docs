# Manage self-service purchases and organizational trials for Microsoft Project

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Microsoft Project will soon be renamed as Microsoft Planner. For more information, see the [new Microsoft Planner](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/planner-blog/the-new-microsoft-planner-a-unified-experience-bringing-together/ba-p/3977998).

Microsoft Project is a tool that helps users to coordinate tasks. It allows for individual and team planning with tasks that have rich content, files, checklists, and more. For users who need more advanced options of project management with extra features, Microsoft Project offers a free trial experience that can help users and administrators decide if the product suits their needs.

As an administrator, you can utilize the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage self-service purchases and trials for Microsoft Project. You can control whether users in your organization can sign up for trials or make purchases.

## Before you begin

Some of these actions may require you to have a specific administrator role to make changes. For a detailed view of roles and capabilities, see [About Microsoft 365 admin roles](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

Understand what types of purchases and trials can be initiated by you or the users in your organization. For more information, see [Product purchase and trial explanation](../../commerce/subscriptions/manage-self-service-purchases-admins.md). The offerings vary by product.

## Enable or disable project trials

You can enable or disable purchases or trials for users in your organization. For instructions on how to use this control, see [Enable or disable purchases and trials via PowerShell module](../add-users/about-admin-roles.md).

If trials are enabled, users have the chance to try Microsoft Project and request a license. If trials are disabled, users won't be allowed to start a trial, but rather will be given the ability to request a license for Microsoft Project.

## Manage license requests

There are a few ways to manage self-service license requests:

1. Approve or deny a license request. For information on approving or denying a license request, see [Approve or Deny a license request](../../commerce/licenses/manage-license-requests.md).
2. Use the option that would align the Microsoft Project-specific process for license request and approval with the prevailing one in your organization. If you would like to align with your organization’s license request and approval process, there's an option to display a message to your users that indicates the process they can follow. Through this message, your users are directed toward your organization’s preferred internal process. For the set-up process, see [Using your own request process](../../commerce/licenses/manage-license-requests.md).
3. Lastly, if you don’t have the authority to approve the license requests, you can share the license-request details to the right point of contact (POC). For instructions regarding sharing the details with the POC, see [Sharing a license request by email](../../commerce/licenses/manage-license-requests.md).

## Cancel a purchase or trial subscription

An administrator can cancel a purchase or trial subscription for their users in the organization. The users will then lose access to certain features in Microsoft Project. The administrator, or the owners of the subscription, on canceling the subscription will receive an email that states that the subscription was canceled.

For instructions on how to cancel a purchase or trial subscription, see [Cancel a purchase or trial subscription](../../commerce/subscriptions/manage-self-service-purchases-admins.md).

The FastTrack request for assistance (RFA) form is now available in the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2226341" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>. Tenant admins use this form to request help from FastTrack specialists on their deployment and migration efforts. FastTrack assistance is available for tenants with 150 or more licenses from one of the [eligible plans](/microsoft-365/fasttrack/eligibility) for the following Microsoft product families: Microsoft 365, Office 365, Microsoft Viva, Enterprise Mobility + Security, and Windows 10/11.

# Summarize an incident with Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft 365 Defender

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft 365 Defender

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The information in this article only applies to the Microsoft Security Copilot Early Access Program, an invite-only paid preview program for commercial customers. Some information in this article relates to prereleased product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

Microsoft 365 Defender applies the capabilities of [Microsoft Security Copilot](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot) to summarize incidents, delivering impactful information and insights to simplify investigation tasks. Attack investigation is a crucial step for incident response teams to successfully defend an organization against further damage from a cyber threat. Investigations can oftentimes be time-consuming since it involves numerous steps. Incident response teams need to understand how the attack happened: sort through numerous alerts, identify which assets and entities are involved, and assess the scope and impact of an attack.

Incident responders can easily gain the right context to investigate and remediate incidents through Microsoft 365 Defender's correlation capabilities and Security Copilot's AI-powered data processing and contextualization. With an incident summary, responders can quickly get important information to help in their investigation.

This guide outlines what to expect and how to access the summarizing capability of Security Copilot within Microsoft 365 Defender, including information on providing feedback.

## Technical requirements

[Learn how you can get started with Security Copilot](/security-copilot/get-started-security-copilot).

## Summarize an incident

Incidents containing up to 100 alerts can be summarized into one incident summary. An incident summary, depending on the availability of the data, includes the following:

- The time and date when an attack started.
- The entity or asset where the attack started.
- A summary of timelines of how the attack unfolded.
- The assets involved in the attack.
- Indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Names of [threat actors](/security/intelligence/microsoft-threat-actor-naming) involved.

To summarize an incident, perform the following steps:

1. Open an incident page. Security Copilot automatically creates an incident summary upon opening the page. You can stop the summary creation by selecting **Cancel** or restart creation by selecting **Regenerate**.

2. The incident summary card loads on the Security Copilot pane in the incident page. Review the generated summary on the card.

3. Select the three dots at the top of the incident summary card to copy or regenerate the summary, or view the summary in Security Copilot. Selecting **Open in Security Copilot** opens a new tab to the Security Copilot standalone portal where you can input prompts and access other plugins.

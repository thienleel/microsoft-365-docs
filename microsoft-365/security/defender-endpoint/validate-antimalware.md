# AV detection test for verifying device's onboarding and reporting services

Anti-malware tests are intended to measure how well the anti-malware software is able to detect, block and remove malware in a variety of scenarios. The test also measures the impact of the anti-malware device on the system's performance.

   Run an AV detection test to verify that the device is properly onboarded and reporting to the service. Perform the following steps on the newly onboarded device:

1. Ensure that real-time protection is enabled (denoted by a result of 1 from running the following command):

```bash
mdatp health --field real_time_protection_enabled
```

2. Open a Terminal window. Copy and execute the following command:

```bash
curl -o ~/Downloads/eicar.com.txt https://www.eicar.org/download/eicar.com.txt
```

3. The file has been quarantined by Defender for Endpoint on Mac. Use the following command to list all the detected threats:

```bash
mdatp threat list
```
